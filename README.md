Speech Understanding Programming Assignment - 1
This repository contains the code and analysis for the Speech Understanding Programming Assignment, focusing on spectrogram analysis and windowing techniques using the UrbanSound8k dataset.
Project Overview
This project explores various aspects of speech processing, including:
Implementation of windowing techniques (Hann, Hamming, and Rectangular)
Generation of spectrograms using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)
Classification of urban sounds using features extracted from spectrograms
Comparative analysis of spectrograms from different music genres
Key Features
Windowing techniques implementation (Hann, Hamming, Rectangular)
STFT-based spectrogram generation
Simple classifier (SVM and Neural Network) for urban sound classification
Spectrogram analysis across different music genres
